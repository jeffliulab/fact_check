Total Facts: 19

Facts to Check:

1. The history of personal computers as mass-market consumer electronic devices began with the microcomputer revolution of the 1970s.
2. A personal computer is one intended for interactive individual use, as opposed to a mainframe computer where the end user's requests are filtered through operating staff, or a time-sharing system in which one large processor is shared by many individuals.
3. After the development of the microprocessor, individual personal computers were low enough in cost that they eventually became affordable consumer goods.
4. Early personal computers – generally called microcomputers – were sold often in electronic kit form and in limited numbers, and were of interest mostly to hobbyists and technicians.
5. Computer terminals were used for time sharing access to central computers.
6. Before the introduction of the microprocessor in the early 1970s, computers were generally large, costly systems owned by large corporations, universities, government agencies, and similar-sized institutions.
7. In 1945, Vannevar Bush published an essay called "As We May Think" in which he outlined a possible solution to the growing problem of information storage and retrieval.
8. In 1968, SRI researcher Douglas Engelbart gave what was later called "The Mother of All Demos", in which he offered a preview of things that have become the staples of daily working life in the 21st century: e-mail, hypertext, word processing, video conferencing, and the mouse.
9. The minicomputer Xerox Alto (1973) was a landmark step in the development of personal computers because of its graphical user interface, bit-mapped high resolution screen, large internal and external memory storage, mouse, and special software.
10. The single-chip microprocessor was made possible by an improvement in MOS technology, the silicon-gate MOS chip, developed in 1968 by Federico Faggin, who later used silicon-gate MOS technology to develop the first single-chip microprocessor, the Intel 4004, in 1971.
11. In 1974 the American electronics magazine Radio-Electronics described the Mark-8 computer kit, based on the Intel 8008 processor.
12. In January of the following year, Popular Electronics magazine published an article describing a kit based on the Intel 8080, a somewhat more powerful and easier to use processor.
13. The Altair 8800 sold remarkably well even though initial memory size was limited to a few hundred bytes and there was no software available.
14. The very first Microsoft product was a 4 kilobyte paper tape BASIC interpreter, which allowed users to develop programs in a higher-level language.
15. Simon was a small electro-mechanical computer project developed by Edmund Berkeley and presented in a thirteen articles series issued in Radio-Electronics magazine from October 1950.
16. The LGP-30 was an off-the-shelf vacuum-tube computer manufactured by the Librascope company of Glendale, California, first manufactured in 1956, at a retail price of $47,000.
17. The IBM 610 was a vacuum-tube computer designed by John Lentz at the Watson Lab of Columbia University, announced by IBM as the 610 Auto-Point in 1957.
18. The LINC (Laboratory INstrument Computer) was an early minicomputer first produced in 1962 at MIT's Lincoln Laboratory.
19. The Programma 101, released in 1965 by the Italian company Olivetti, was one of the first printing programmable calculators.
