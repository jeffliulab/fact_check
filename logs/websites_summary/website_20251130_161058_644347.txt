Viacheslav Vasilyevich Ragozin (Russian: Вячесла́в Васи́льевич Раго́зин; 8 October 1908 – 11 March 1962) was a Soviet chess player, writer and editor. He was world champion in correspondence chess and held the title of Grandmaster in both over-the-board and correspondence chess.

Chess career[edit]

Born in Saint Petersburg, Ragozin's chess career first came to the fore with a series of excellent results in the 1930s. In the earliest of these, he defeated the respected master Alexander Ilyin-Genevsky in a 1930 match and was himself awarded the title of Soviet master. At Moscow 1935, he won the best game prize for his victory against Andor Lilienthal. At the very strong Moscow tournament of 1936, he beat Salo Flohr and Emanuel Lasker and came very close to defeating José Raúl Capablanca, the ever-resourceful ex-world champion scrambling to find a draw by perpetual check at the game's frantic conclusion.[1] There followed a victory at the Leningrad championship of 1936 and second place shared with Alexander Konstantinopolsky (behind Grigory Levenfish) at the Soviet Championship of 1937. At the 1939 Leningrad-Moscow tournament, he finished third equal, behind Flohr and Samuel Reshevsky, but ahead of Paul Keres.

Success continued into the 1940s with first prize at Sverdlovsk in 1942 and a repeat triumph at the Leningrad Championship of 1945. In 1946, he finished outright first at Helsinki and beat Igor Bondarevsky in a match. His greatest achievement in over-the-board chess then followed at the Mikhail Chigorin Memorial tournament of 1947, held in Moscow, where he placed second, half a point behind Mikhail Botvinnik and ahead of Vasily Smyslov, Isaac Boleslavsky and Keres.

By the 1950s, he and most of his generation had been overtaken by the new wave of players emerging from the Soviet chess schools, but Ragozin continued his patronage of the Soviet Championship, competing a total of eleven times, from 1934 to 1956. Of his rare post-1950 international tournament appearances, his best result came at the 1956 Wilhelm Steinitz Memoria
